# Animated & Interactive Web GL 

On the theme of "space" I decided to create a little pixelized universe around an astronaut named Jacob.  

## Features Presentation 

Camera orientation : depending on where is your cursor you can change your point of view.

Music : Press space bar to play a nice ambient music which you can pause any time by pressing again the space bar.

Diamands : Click on one of the four diamonds to add a light. Each diamons has a different light color corresponding to their own. You can associate them all together, let only two, three, one... All combinaisons are possible. Clicking again on a diamond will turn off its light.

Astronaut : If you click on the astronaut it will shut down all the lights if you want a clean space for making other lights combinaisons

Sounds : Clicking on a diamond to turn on the light make a sound, which is different when you turn off this one.

##Disclamer

Dist file is not complete. Textures, audio and Jacob couldn't be built :( . Sorry but to seen the full experience you will have to open this project with your server.
